Queries form the basic building blocks for interacting with relational databases,
allowing you to perform a wide range of data manipulation and retrieval operations.

Here's a brief description of each type of SQL query:

SELECT: This query is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. You can specify the columns you want to retrieve and the table from which you want to retrieve them.

WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows returned by a SELECT statement based on a specified condition. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet certain criteria.

INSERT INTO: This query is used to insert new records into a table. You specify the table name and the values you want to insert into each column.

UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. You can update one or more columns in one or more rows based on a specified condition.

DELETE: DELETE is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a specified condition. It removes the data entirely from the table.

JOIN: JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query.

GROUP BY: This clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG) to perform calculations on grouped data.

ORDER BY: ORDER BY is used to sort the result set by one or more columns in ascending or descending order. It allows you to control the order in which the rows are returned.

DISTINCT: DISTINCT is used to return only unique values in the result set. It removes duplicate rows from the output.

LIMIT: LIMIT is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It is often used in conjunction with ORDER BY to retrieve a specific number of rows from the beginning or end of a result set.

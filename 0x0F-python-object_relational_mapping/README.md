Object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python is a programming technique that allows developers to work with relational databases using an object-oriented approach. In traditional database interaction, data is stored in tables, and queries are written in SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve, update, or delete records. However, this approach can become cumbersome when dealing with complex data structures or when trying to integrate databases with object-oriented programming languages like Python.

ORM frameworks provide a way to bridge the gap between the relational model of databases and the object-oriented model of programming languages. Here's a brief overview of how ORM works in Python:

Object-Relational Mapping: ORM frameworks map database tables to Python classes and map rows in those tables to instances of those classes. This allows developers to interact with database records using familiar object-oriented programming paradigms.

Models: In an ORM framework, developers define classes (often referred to as "models") that represent the structure of the data stored in the database. Each attribute of the class typically corresponds to a column in the corresponding database table.

Mapping Configuration: Developers use configuration files or annotations to specify how the ORM framework should map between the database tables and the Python classes.

Querying: Instead of writing SQL queries directly, developers use methods provided by the ORM framework to interact with the database. These methods typically allow for querying, filtering, updating, and deleting records using Python syntax.

Transactions: ORM frameworks often provide mechanisms for managing database transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Database Agnostic: ORM frameworks abstract away the details of the underlying database system, allowing developers to switch between different database engines (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) without needing to modify their code.

Popular ORM frameworks in Python include SQLAlchemy, Django's ORM (built into the Django web framework), Peewee, and Pony ORM. Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and features, but they all aim to simplify database interaction by providing a high-level, object-oriented interface.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
It provides a standard way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform tasks such as querying data,
updating data, inserting new data, and deleting data. SQL is commonly used by developers, database administrators,
and data analysts to work with data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL,
PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and others.

SQL is divided into several categories of commands, including:

Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes,
and constraints. Commands in this category include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate data within the database.
Commands in this category include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Data Control Language (DCL): Used to control access to data within the database.
Commands in this category include GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to grant and revoke privileges respectively.

Transaction Control Language (TCL): Used to manage transactions within the database.
Commands in this category include COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

SQL syntax is standardized, but each database management system may have its own dialect or extensions to the standard. 
However, the core principles of SQL remain consistent across different database systems.
